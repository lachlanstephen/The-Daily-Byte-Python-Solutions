<h1>The Daily Byte Challenge - Python Solution</h1>

<h4><i>UPDATE</i>: It should be noted, these repo is now on the backburner as I am now working and focusing on a C version of The Daily Byte solutions. This is since attending the 42 School Piscine, which is entirely in C, to keep up with my C programming. My C solution repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/lachlanstephen/The-Daily-Byte-C-Solutions" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</h4>

<p>These are my solutions to The Daily Byte daily problems. The Daily Byte solutions are currently offered in Java, however I am attempting to learn Python further, so thought I'd upload my python solutions as I go along.</p>

<p>If you see any issues with my code or think I could improve the solution (whether it be in regards to time or space complexity, or anything at all), please let me know! (Probably by forking my repo and putting your own solution up with comments for me to see).</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying these problems out for yourself, I encourage you to sign up for The Daily Byte daily problems here at <a href="https://thedailybyte.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Daily Byte</a>, and try not to look at my code till after you've completed your own responses.</p>

<p>To be clear, I am not sponsored or anything, I just think they're doing a good thing :)</p>
