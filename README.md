<h1>The Daily Byte Challenge - Python Solution</h1>

<p>These are my solutions to The Daily Byte daily problems. The Daily Byte solutions are currently offered in Java, however I am attempting to learn Python further, so thought I'd upload my python solutions.</p>

<p>If you see any issues with my code or think I could improve the solution (whether it be in regards to time or space complexity, or anything at all), please let me know!</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying these problems out for yourself, I encourage you to sign up for The Daily Byte daily problems here at <a href="https://thedailybyte.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Daily Byte</a>, and try not to look at my code till after you've completed your own responses.</p>

<aside>To be clear, I am not sponsored or anything, I just think they're doing a good thing :\)</aside>
